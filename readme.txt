My greasemonkey scripts.


Twitch
   - quick links to popout and chat
   - live playlist links
   - archive download links
      - link text is formatted (a download manager such as DownThemAll can use that info for the filename)
      - most of the link text is hidden for readability but remains useable regarding the previous point


Youtube
   - disables ytspf (ajax page loading & history.pushState)
   - video download links
      - link text is formatted (a download manager such as DownThemAll can use that info for the filename)
      - some videos are "protected" and download will fail (I'm not annoyed enough to look into it)
   - proxfree links
   - sets wmode of embedded flash player to "direct"
      - accelerated video rendering
      - no hiccup on fullscreen switching


Hitbox
   - archive download links
      - link text is formatted (a download manager such as DownThemAll can use that info for the filename)
